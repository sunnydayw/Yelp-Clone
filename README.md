# Project 3 - *Yeap*

**Yeap** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. using google map API vs iOS Map Kit
2. How to process JSON data. (BDBOAuth1Manager)
